## MIDISense | MIDI FIle Interpretation

---
This system enables the interpretation, display, playback and analysis of musical data stored in a midi format.

Music forms an integral part of modern society. 
It is without a doubt, the most ubiquitous of art forms, permeating through the day-to-day lives of most individuals in some form or another and is one that most people would find challenging to live without.

As with most artistic disciplines, the accessibility of music and a rise in music education among the youth have made its practises an appropriate target for rapid digitisation. As the composition, arrangement and transcription of works are common industry practises, there has been a drive in recent years to marry these processes with technologies that enhance both the sensory and extrasensory perception of a work during such tasks.

## The team

NoXception is a team of five third-year EBIT undergraduates from the University of
Pretoria with a determination to embody best practices in real-world software
engineering. We have the drive to engage in development projects which challenge us
on a professional basis and enrich us on a personal level.

![Alt text](documentation/images/noxcpetion.png?raw=true "Title")

We have achieved a working knowledge of industry standards in software development and are capable of applying
the skills we have learnt throughout our degree to pressing real-world concerns. Our
combined skills and interests also encompass a wealth of diverse fields outside of
computer science and software engineering such as statistics, pure mathematics, design
and music.
